      <p>This global simulation invites you to use currently available technology to
      <ul>
        <li>design our climate future, </li>
        <li>use what you learn in this process to engage in conversations about how these <span
            class="glossary">greenhouse gas (GHG)</span> reductions can be achieved in time, and</li>
        <li><strong>create your own action plan</strong> to help tackle this complex and difficult challenge.</li>
      </ul>
      </p>

      <p>Billions of humans living on our planet require energy for all aspects of life, and contribute to changes in
        global <span class="glossary">biogeochemical cycles</span>. This simulation focuses on human-caused <span
          class="glossary">greenhouse gas</span> emissions, and the expected impacts these will have on four parameters
        that regulate important aspects of our physical world: global <span class="glossary">greenhouse gas</span>
        concentrations, ocean acidity, average global surface temperature, and sea level rise. At the top of the
        simulation is an interactive graph of projected <span class="glossary">greenhouse gas</span> emissions, and
        effects of those emissions are shown on the impact circle below.</p>

      <ol class="instructionsBg">
        <li>Select each emissions sector with buttons above the graph.</li>
        <li>Move the sliders in each sector, to design the changes in those activities you’d like to see humans achieve
          to chart our ,span class = "glossary">sustainable</span> future. The starting position of the arrow at the top
          of the yellow triangle
          represents our current trajectory, 'business as usual', where no major <span
            class="glossary">technological</span> or <span class="glossary">behavioral</span> changes are made.</li>
        <li>As you change the sliders, keep an eye on the Reality Check bar just below the graph, to see if your changes
          are realistic. The question mark icons on any part of the model show the assumptions at work.</li>
      </ol>

      <p><strong>Can you design a future in which we have brought the projected <span class="glossary">greenhouse
            gas</span> emissions down close to <span class="glossary">net zero </span> by 2050, helping to avoid some of
          the worst impacts of <span class="glossary">climate change</span>?</strong></p>

      <p>This simulation gives a semi-quantitative overview of <span class="glossary">anthropogenic</span> <span
          class="glossary">greenhouse
          gas</span> emissions, or human activities that release heat-absorbing (and, in the case of <span
          class="glossary">carbon dioxide</span>, acidic)
        compounds into the atmosphere. This includes the compounds <span class="glossary">carbon dioxide</span>,
        <span class="glossary">methane</span>, <span class="glossary">nitrogen oxides</span>, and <span
          class="glossary">hydrofluorocarbons</span>. Of these, <span class="glossary">carbon dioxide</span> is by far
        the most abundant <a class="reference">(IPCC 2013)</a>. Note that this simulation excludes several other
        environmentally relevant compounds, such as <span class="glossary">ozone</span>, and <span
          class="glossary">sulfur hexafluoride</span>.</p>

        </svg> Model Simplification—Data Representation
      </h4>

      <p>When predicting the impact of certain solutions on the future of global greenhouse gas emissions, unless
        stated otherwise, it is assumed that no <span class="glossary">technological</span> improvements will be made.
        This was
        done to simplify the design
        of the simulation. As a result, predictions made within the simulation tend to be <span
          class="glossary">conservative</span>.</p>

      <p>In this model, the <span class="glossary">greenhouse gas</span> emissions from all slider settings are added
        together to give the total
        projected global emissions in 2050, and the most recently available data is connected to 2050 with a straight
        line. Note that emissions are not expected to change linearly between now and 2050. The scenarios with the
        lowest negative impacts on human life reach peak emissions very soon, and then rapidly decrease emissions by
        2050. This is simplified as the bottom line on the graph, labeled "<span class="glossary">Resilient</span>
        Pathway". </p>

      <p>The initial settings of the simulation are considered to be the outcome of continuing with 'business as usual'
        until 2050. The total global emissions are <span class="glossary" data-glossary="calibration">calibrated</span>
        to match the <span class='glossary'>RCP</span>8.5 'worst case business as usual' scenario <a
          class="reference">(IPCC2013)</a> <span class="glossary">greenhouse gas</span> emission projection
        in 2050. This is done so that the simulation, which is vastly simplified compared to scientific climate models,
        gives <span class="glossary" data-glossary="qualitative">qualitatively</span> meaningful predictions even though
        it ignores
        a number of important <span class="glossary">dependencies</span> and interactions. When an input is changed, the
        model calculates the
        resulting change in projected <span class="glossary">greenhouse gas</span> emissions, and subtracts that change
        from the "business as usual"
        starting point.

      <p>This simulation does not intend to be an all-encompassing representation of mitigation strategies, but rather
        an exercise in seeing how different technologies, and the various combinations of them, address the reduction of
        <span class="glossary">anthropogenic</span> <span class="glossary">greenhouse gas</span> emissions. Note that
        some excluded areas include waste management and plastics recycling, military aircraft carrier task forces, many
        emissions associated with the manufacturing of clothing and consumer goods, and building envelopes. Some of
        these areas are more important to the biodiversity loss issue than the climate, while others actually have low
        impact. Areas like food transportation and the electrical and shipping emissions from the clothing industry are
        included in the model, but not highlighted.</p>

      <p>Even a reasonably safe boundary may be problematic when the rate of change exceeds the capacity of an organism
        or ecosystem to adapt.</p>
      <p>All impacts are modeled based on the total emissions to 2100, based on a linear extrapolation of the 2050
        emissions to 2050. Negative emissions are not included; when the emissions pathway reaches 0, it is assumes that

      <p>There are two main contributors to sea level rise: ocean expansion and melting ice. Water expands as it warms,
        and the melting of land-based ice (such as the glaciers of Greenland and Antarctica) adds more water to the
        oceans. The melting of floating ice does not contribute to sea level rise (try this with a glass of ice
        water!)—but has other effects, including changing Earth's ability to absorb or reflect sunlight. Sea level rise
        also affects coastal and island communities-the ocean rise floods habitable areas, as well as low-lying
        agricultural lands.</p>

      <p>When <span class="glossary">carbon dioxide</span> reacts with water, some of it forms carbonic acid, increasing
        the acidity of oceans. pH is
        a measure of acidity: more acidic environments have a lower pH. Lower ocean pH makes it difficult for many
        shelled organisms to grow. Since the industrial revolution in 1750, the ocean pH has decreased by 0.1 units,
        from 8.2 to 8.1 <a class="reference ">(NOAA OA)</a>. Because pH is a logarithmic scale, this actually
        corresponds to approximately 30% increase in acidity. When ocean acidity rises, carbonate in the shells of sea
        creatures becomes more soluble, and their shells can begin to dissolve <a class="reference ">(NOAA OA)</a>. To

      <p>In combination with lifestyle changes since the Industrial Revolution, the increase in global population is a

      <hr>
      <p><em>This slider is non-categorical and will appear on every page.</em></p>
      <p>Carbon capture and storage (CCS) refers to a variety of technologies that capture CO<sub>2</sub> from
        industrial
        processes, and either store or use the CO<sub>2</sub> for other processes such as CO<sub>2</sub>-enhanced
        oil recovery (EOR). CCS can be used in a variety of sectors, including <span class="glossary">fossil fuel</span>
        processing, <span class="glossary">electricity</span>
        production, fertilizer production, and concrete manufacturing. The slider in this model only considers the
        impact of CCS in <span class="glossary">fossil fuel</span> production for heating and transportation, and the
        use of <span class="glossary">coal</span> and <span class="glossary">natural gas</span> in
        <span class="glossary">electricity</span> production. CCS in the agriculture is considered in the "Decrease in
        emissions from crop and livestock management and food waste" slider.
      </p>
      <p> CCS is still a fairly new technology, but currently available technologies have already been implemented at
        facilities around the world <span class="reference">(GCCSI2019)</span>. However, the number of these facilities
        is fairly small, so the default value of this slider is set at <span class="autofill-data"
          data-constant="CCSPercent"></span>.
        When implemented, CCS can reduce the emissions of a single plant or processing facility by 90%, and it is
        estimated that one third of facilities can implement these technologies by 2050 <span
          class="reference">(Pembina2014)</span>, for a total emissions reduction of <span class="autofill-data"
          data-constant="CCSPercent" data-property="maxFeasible"></span>.The simulation does not
        consider technologies for the direct air capture
        of emissions. Direct air capture, which removes <span classs="glossary">carbon dioxide</span> from ambient air
        (containing just 0.04% carbon
        dioxide), is still under development.</p>

        cooling buildings are included here in the total <span class="glossary">electricity</span> production. The
        worldwide demand for cooling buildings made up almost 10% of the total <span class="glossary">electricity</span>

      <p>When other <span class="glossary">electricity</span> sources are increased, the simulation will automatically

        order to be able to increase other contributions. It's important to note that the <span
          class="glossary">alternative energy</span> sources for <span class="glossary">electricity</span> are
        not considered <span class="glossary">carbon neutral</span>. The carbon intensities, listed in g <span

      <p>Solar <span class="glossary">PV</span> can be either <span class="glossary">grid connected</span> or function
